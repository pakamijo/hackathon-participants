# Precipitation Nowcasting — Dataset Guide

## Overview

San Cristóbal Island in the Galápagos has a network of four weather stations operated by the Galápagos Science Center (GSC) and the Institute of Geography at Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ). These stations record meteorological variables at 15-minute intervals and have been running since June 2015.

The goal is to build an **AI-based Early Warning System** that predicts the probability of heavy precipitation or anomalous temperature at 3, 6, and 12-hour horizons (**nowcasting**), by identifying precursor patterns in the meteorological time series.

### Data Quality Notes

- **Significant data gaps** exist across all stations due to sensor failures and maintenance periods. Gap handling is a first-class concern for any modeling approach.
- **NA values** are common, especially in the min/max/avg columns which were only added in March 2025.
- **Timestamp format** is `month/day/year hour:minute` — parse with `pd.to_datetime(df['TIMESTAMP'], format='%m/%d/%Y %H:%M')`.
- Battery voltage (BattV_Avg) and panel temperature (PTemp_C_Avg) are station health indicators, not meteorological variables, but drops in battery voltage can correlate with cloudy/rainy conditions.

### Quick Start — Reading LDAS Data

```python
import netCDF4
import numpy as np

ds = netCDF4.Dataset('ldas/SURF_MOD_gal_001_daily_LIS_HIST.nc')

# Time axis
times = netCDF4.num2date(ds['time'][:], ds['time'].units)

# Air temperature at one grid cell (e.g., row=300, col=250) across all days
temp_K = ds['Tair_f_tavg'][:, 300, 250]
temp_C = temp_K - 273.15

# Precipitation rate → daily accumulation (mm/day)
rain_rate = ds['Rainf_tavg'][:, 300, 250]  # kg/m²/s
rain_mm_day = rain_rate * 86400             # 1 kg/m² = 1 mm

ds.close()
```

## Project Ideas

### Core Task — Precipitation Nowcasting

Build a model that predicts heavy precipitation events at 3, 6, and 12-hour horizons using station time series data. Recommended approaches:

- **RNN / LSTM / GRU** — sequence models that learn temporal dependencies in the multivariate time series
- **XGBoost / LightGBM** — tree-based models with engineered lag features (e.g., rainfall in the last 1h, 3h, 6h; humidity trends; wind direction shifts)
- **Hybrid** — use tree models for feature importance analysis, then feed top features into a sequence model

Key modeling decisions:
- How do you define "heavy precipitation"? (threshold on Rain_mm_Tot — e.g., top 5% of nonzero readings)
- How do you handle data gaps? (interpolation, masking, or gap-aware architectures)
- Single-station models vs multi-station models that capture spatial correlations across the island

### Extension Ideas

- **Cross-station spatial modeling** — the four stations span a coastal-to-highland transect. Weather systems often move across the island in predictable patterns. Can information from one station predict events at another?

- **Soil moisture as a leading indicator** — soil moisture (VW) responds to rainfall but also to subsurface water movement. Do soil moisture trends at deeper horizons (VW_2, VW_3) provide early warning of heavy rain?

- **Leaf wetness signals** — the leaf wetness sensor (LWMWet_Tot, LWMDry_Tot) provides a direct proxy for surface moisture. Is it a better predictor than humidity alone?

- **LDAS as spatial context** — extract the LDAS grid cell(s) nearest each weather station and use the gridded variables as additional features. The LDAS provides mesoscale atmospheric context that a single point station cannot capture. This requires finding the station coordinates — they can be obtained from the live dashboard map at https://weathergsc.usfq.edu.ec/ or by contacting the station operators.

- **LDAS pretraining** — pretrain a temporal encoder on the 2403-day LDAS sequences (predict next-day surface conditions), then fine-tune on the higher-frequency station data. The LDAS provides continuous daily coverage without gaps, making it ideal for learning general atmospheric dynamics before specializing to 15-minute nowcasting.

- **Representation learning with paired data** — during the 2015–2021 overlap period, station and LDAS data are available simultaneously. Train a model to align station point observations with gridded spatial context (e.g., contrastive learning), then use the learned representations for downstream nowcasting.

- **Hydrological flood indicators** — the ROUTING file contains streamflow, river depth, and flooded area. These are direct consequences of heavy precipitation and could serve as auxiliary prediction targets or validation signals.

- **Anomalous temperature prediction** — beyond precipitation, predict temperature anomalies (deviations from seasonal norms) at the same 3/6/12h horizons. Temperature on the Galápagos is influenced by ENSO, ocean currents, and altitude — different dynamics than precipitation.
